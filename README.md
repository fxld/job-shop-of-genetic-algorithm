My first project at cauc
Solving job shop scheduling problem based on genetic algorithm
About the job shop scheduling: N workpieces are processed on M machines. Each workpiece has a specific processing technology. The order of each workpiece processing and the time spent in each process are given. The processing order of workpieces on each machine is arranged so as to optimize a certain index.
